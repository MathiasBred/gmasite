                “Gabby and the Cows”, a children’s chapter book, is based on a true story, related to me by my mother.   Gabby is my young mother, growing up in Kansas.  Her Pop was a farmer and each day her job was to drive the horse driven wagon to the field he was working in to bring him lunch and fresh water.  But there was one problem.  In order to reach Pop, she had to drive through a field of cows.  And she was terrified of cows.

                My mother really did grow up in Kansas, the daughter of a farmer.  And she did take lunch and water to her Pop and was afraid of the cows.  Somehow, she did endure and survive the heat of Kansas summers, as she and her sisters and brothers worked and played in the hot summer sun.
