                Have you ever watched a bird arrive in the Spring?  Have you observed them chirping and singing loudly to attract a mate?  Seen them build a nest, lay eggs, then feed the young after they hatch?  Then watch as they learn to feed themselves and learn to fly?  Year after year, this process occurs over and over, and is extremely exciting to see!

                In this children’s picture book, watch Connor and Katie, tiny wrens, as they journey through this process.  The book is filled with photographs of wrens , doing what all birds do in the Spring.  Follow them on their journey to keep the world filled with beautiful song.

                The wren is my favorite bird and I have spent many a Spring watching them in my yard.  And listening to them as they sound their wondrous warbling song.  I’ve always been amazed that something so tiny {a wren only grows to be about 3 inches long}, sing such a loud song.  Sing loudly, sing proudly little bird!
