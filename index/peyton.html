                    Peyton is an English Bulldog.  She loves her family and they love her.  They take her wherever they go, and they go many places!  But Peyton has a knack for having fun, no matter where she is.  One day, they all go camping.  Including Peyton, of course.   When it was time for sleep, however, the family got  a surprise.  What could it be?

                    These four children are my grandsons, and Peyton is their beloved dog.  She is a wonderful, caring, people pleasing, and fun loving addition to the family.  Making good memories is what it is all about for this family and their furry friend!
