                    “In a ditch, alongside a country road, wildflowers and other plants grew.  In that ditch, grasses, lilies, Queen Anne’s Lace, clovers, and milkweeds made their home.  In the midst of these plants, Rosebud, a beautiful pink wild rose, and Daisy Mae, a wild daisy, grew.  Daisy Mae and Rosebud were best friends.”  Taken from “Daisy Mae and Rosebud”.

                    I have always loved flowers, especially wildflowers.  Wildflowers that grow in ditches, grasses and woods.  Hence, this story.   I have occasionally wondered if plants, flowers in particular, have a secret life when the sun goes down and are not seen by humans.  Do they communicate with each other?  I have seen them wave at on another.  So…

                    Imagining is one of the very best things a child can do and this beautifully illustrated children’s picture book certainly encourages that.  Enjoy!
