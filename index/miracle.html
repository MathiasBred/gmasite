                This book is an adult chapter book, not a   children’s book.  I wrote it because of circumstances in my life that compelled me to do so. 
                
                June 3, 2009, was a life changing day for me.  I was a special education teacher and it was the last day of the school year.  I had activities planned to send the children on their way to summer.  But they didn’t come to pass.  I awoke that morning with the worst headache I had ever experienced.  I tried to get up and get going, but I could not move.  Luckily, my husband was home and knew it was my head that hurt.  Shortly,  I passed into an unconsciousness that lasted for days. My family did everything for me.  I had a brainbleed/stroke, was airlifted to a trauma hospital, underwent brain surgery and was given a small chance of living.  But, I did!

                Miracle in Room 423 is the story of my journey back to health.  I’m not completely where I was, but I’m still alive and can function normally. By the grace of God,  I truly am a miracle!
