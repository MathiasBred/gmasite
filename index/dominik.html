                Have you ever watched deer scampering across the road or playing in the wood?  Just imagine if we could know what they were thinking and feeling?  
                </p>
                <p style='text-indent: 5%'>
                This is a story about twin  fawns, Damian and Dominik, who are born in the spring of the year, as all fawns are.  Mother Deer makes certain they are born in a safe place, inside a fence, where they will not encounter outside predators.  All is well until the day she asks them to jump out of the fenced area, where they are safe and sound, and join the outside world to learn how to live on their own.  Not an easy task, as Dominik discovers!

                I was fortunate to watch this scenario unfold and made a story of it, complete with authentic photographs.  Read and see what happens to the twins during their first spring and summer.  Actually, the adventure is a bit of a miracle!
