                     Getting adopted and staying adopted can be difficult.  In Pink Shoes for Maria, Maria and her sister  and brother are being adopted.  The mom and dad who are trying to make it happen are wonderful people, but there are struggles to be overcome, especially trusting anyone after being given up and spending your first couple of years in foster care.  Read and find out how Maria overcomes these struggles.

                     I am Maria.  I was adopted when I was three years old, along with my younger brother and sister.   To a wonderful couple.  And my life was changed forever.  Pink Shoes for Maria is based on a true story of events that actually happened to me as I was adopted.   I have attempted to convey the many emotions that were felt by me and other children living through this experience.  I hope you will read and enjoy this heartfelt reminiscence of days gone by.
