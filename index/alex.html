                If you live far enough from the Equator, trees change as the year passes from winter to spring to summer to fall.  After fall, as winter approaches, they appear to die, but in truth, are only sleeping.  Have you ever watched and wondered about this process?  Or considered how the trees must feel?  I’m certain most young children think about it.  And they must imagine, as all children do!

                As a writer of children’s books, I also wonder about these things.  That is why I followed a strong maple tree throughout a year and tried to imagine how it must feel, passing through each season.

                I named my tree Alex, after my grandson who often swings and plays in our maple tree in the summer.  I thought about how joyful the tree must feel as Alex and the other grandchildren climbed high in its branches, swung high on the swings attached to its branches, and jumped in its leaves in the autumn.  What memories were made!
