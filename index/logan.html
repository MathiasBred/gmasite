                 Chipmunks can be very naughty and mischievous, it is true!  But they are so much fun to watch as they scurry and scamper and get into just about everything they can find.  Logan is no different.  He is a small chipmunk who lives in the Morey yard.  He is a bit naughty, he is curious, and he is very busy all the time.  And heâ€™s always getting into things.  But one day, when Logan is busy playing, he confronts danger.  Danger  he was not prepared for.  There seems to be no way to get away.  What can he do?  Where can he go?
                </p>

                 I have spent many hours watching and photographing chipmunks in my yard.  They are extremely captivating and one, in particular, deserved to become a story.  Read and discover how Logan frees himself from danger.  What a lucky little fellow he was!

                 Enjoy this adorable little creature, just as I did.
